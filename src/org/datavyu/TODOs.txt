For the MovieStream native implementation:
-- Debug stopping of images -- there is an additional frame displayed (DONE)
-- Debug stopping of audio signal -- it does continue to play for about 250 ms
   Can't be fixed because it is in the java implementation
-- Debug crash when re-opening video: Fixed added component to container when
   stream open event; instead add it to the constructor of the 
   VideoDisplayStreamListener.
-- Test viewing window; Crashed with exception in WritableRaster; had to 
   re-initialize the SampleModel in the streamData method of the 
   VideoDisplayStreamListener. 
-- Test forward/backward, switching speed for a video with audio signal, 
   including testing of -4x, +4x.  Noticed that sound plays in a loop! Best 
   solution stop the audio thread!  (Natively the audio is stopped).
   Play back speeds are working. Muted audio play back when running not at 1x.
   
-- Add update of slider
-- Add slider to select time in stream
